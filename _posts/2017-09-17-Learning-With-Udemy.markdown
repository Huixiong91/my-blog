In the field of `Software Engineering`, constant learning is paramount to staying relevant. In this article, I will share about my learning experience at [Udemy][5a2fe39c].

  [5a2fe39c]: https://www.udemy.com/ "Go to Udemy"

In case you didn't know, Udemy is an online learning & teaching marketplace. It has a huge catalog of courses on just about anything, from `Development`, `Business`, `Design`, `Marketing` to `Health & Fitness`.

Early this year, I was on a lookout for a course on native `iOS` development with `Swift`. I chanced upon and bought my first course [iOS 10 & Swift 3: From Beginner to Paid Professional](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/). Now that Swift 4 and iOS 11 are released, there are newer courses on it now. That's one huge plus point on Udemy; it's very relevant.

Things I like about Udemy

1. It is very relevant and updated.
2. Includes preview. It's good to have a glimpse of how the instructor conducts the course.
3. There's rating and reviews to get a rough sensing of the course quality before committing.

It ultimately became my default go-to station whenever I need to learn a new Programming Language or Framework. I went on to purchase the following courses, and I highly recommend them.
1. [Angular 4 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2)
2. [Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex) ](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide)
3. [Accelerated JavaScript Training](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-bootcamp-2016)
4. [Accelerated ES6 JavaScript Training](https://www.udemy.com/es6-bootcamp-next-generation-javascript)


Before you get put off by the price, fear not, they often have discount code throughout the year. All the courses I have bought were for just a mere S$15. A steal if I might add.

_Tips: For Singaporean aged 25 or above, Udemy courses are claimable on [SkillsFuture](http://www.skillsfuture.sg/)._
