# Hello World

A very warm welcome to my blog, I am a Final Year Computer Science undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

In this cozy digital space of mine, I'll write and share my personal thoughts on `Software Engineering`. I will also from time to time include articles pertaining to `Personal Finance` in Singapore.

I hope that you will be able to find value and learn a thing or two here. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
